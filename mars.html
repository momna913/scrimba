    <h1>mars</h1>
    <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is often called the “Red Planet” because of its reddish surface, which is caused by iron dust. Unlike Earth, Mars is cold, dry, and has a thin atmosphere. Scientists are very interested in Mars because it may have had water in the past and could be explored for future human missions.</p>
